		<h2 id="centered">This report is based off of one run of the simulation with 100 million trials. Results may vary.</h2>

		<p>For our simulation project, we chose to simulate an "annoying board game". Here is the layout of said board game:</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p>To move, a player flips a coin. If they get heads, they move forward 1 step. If they get tails, they move forward 2 steps. We simulate the distribution of move is takes to finish the game.</p>
		<p>Our code simulates playing the game, and stores the number of moves it took.</p>

		<p>The simulation works by having a board array, which is [0, 0, 0, -3, 0]. It randomizes a number between 1 and 2, and adds it to the current position. It then adds the value of the array at the position to the position. This siulates the back to start square. If the position is at the end, or later, it stops and stores the number of moves it took.</p>

		<p>This code proved an issue to write. Getting Q1 isn't difficult when you are working with an array where each element is once data point. However, in our code, each element in the array is a number of moves, and the value at that element stores how many games ended in that many moves. This code finds the element that would be the Q1, and uses subtraction to move through the value array.</p>

		<h3 id="centered">Minimum: 2   Q1: 3   Median: 5   Q3: 8   Maximum: 15.5</h3>
		<p>Here are the results from 100 million trials. The data are skewed right significantly. This is likely because flipping tails twice has a 25% chance and ends the game in 2 moves, with the rest dropping in frequency, with the exception of 3 and 4. The data are centered at a median of 5. This means that there is a 50% chance the game will end in 5 or less moves. The data also are not very spread. While they have a tail coming off the end, A huge amount of games, 75%, end in 8 or less moves. This means that you can estimate the number of moves in a game fairly accurately.</p>
